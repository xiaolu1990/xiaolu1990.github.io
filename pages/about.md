# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** 👋,

I am an electronics designer currently based in NRW, Germany. As daily business, I work around with hardware design and firmware programming back and forth. I like learning new stuff by practicing it, and of course, I made mistakes during the journey. That's one of the motivation that I shared my learning experience by taking notes and publish in my blog.

Check out my projects and blogs, and you'r welcome to exchange thoughts and to share your knowledge! 🍻🍻
